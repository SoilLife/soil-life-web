        a soccer field of soil is eroded every 5 seconds, an area the size of new york is sealed up every day, and 33%
        of the worldâ€™s soils are considered moderately to highly degraded. this poses an existential threat -- to our
        food supply and the global economy. there is a great opportunity to improve soil health and provide solutions to
        global challenges.
